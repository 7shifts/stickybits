#StickyBits

> StickyBits is a JavaScript Plugin that ensures sticky elements stick as desired within a browser html document. 

This is not a `position: sticky` polyfill. Stickybits accepts that how an element sticks is unimportant compared to it sticking in an expected and performant way.ðŸ‘Œ
